# Creative Analysis Module Refactoring

## Overview

This module represents a refactored version of the original `creative_endpoint.py` file, which was 1,546 lines and difficult to maintain. The code has been broken down into smaller, focused modules.

## Module Structure

```
backend/services/creative/
├── __init__.py          # Package initialization and exports
├── models.py            # Data models, schemas, and constants
├── account_context.py   # Account lookup and context management
├── analysis.py          # Core business logic for creative analysis
├── routes.py            # FastAPI route definitions
└── README.md           # This documentation
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Models**: All data structures, constants, and schemas in one place
- **Account Context**: Isolated account lookup logic with environment variable support
- **Analysis**: Core business logic separated from routing
- **Routes**: Clean API endpoint definitions

### 2. **Environment Variable Support**
- Hardcoded test account IDs replaced with `os.getenv()` calls
- Fallback values maintained for development
- Better security for production deployments

### 3. **Improved Maintainability**
- Each module has a single responsibility
- Easier to test individual components
- Cleaner import structure
- Better error handling

### 4. **Backward Compatibility**
- Original endpoint remains unchanged at `/api/creative-analysis`
- New refactored endpoint available at `/api/creative-analysis-v2`
- Both can run simultaneously during transition

## Usage

### Including in FastAPI App
```python
from services.creative import creative_router

app.include_router(creative_router, tags=["creative-v2"])
```

### API Endpoints

#### New Refactored Endpoints:
- `POST /api/creative-analysis-v2` - Main creative analysis endpoint
- `GET /api/creative-questions` - Get all available questions
- `GET /api/creative-questions/{category}` - Get questions by category

#### Original Endpoint (Still Available):
- `POST /api/creative-analysis` - Original implementation

## Environment Variables

The refactored module supports these environment variables for test accounts:

```bash
DEV_USER_ID=106540664695114193744
DEV_DFSA_GOOGLE_ADS_ID=7574136388
DEV_DFSA_GA4_PROPERTY_ID=458016659
DEV_CHERRY_TIME_GOOGLE_ADS_ID=8705861821
DEV_CHERRY_TIME_GA4_PROPERTY_ID=292652926
DEV_ONVLEE_GOOGLE_ADS_ID=7482456286
DEV_ONVLEE_GA4_PROPERTY_ID=428236885
```

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy both endpoints (current status)
2. **Phase 2**: Update frontend to use v2 endpoint
3. **Phase 3**: Remove original endpoint after testing
4. **Phase 4**: Clean up unused imports and dependencies

## Testing

Test the new endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/api/creative-analysis-v2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Which creative format is driving the most engagement?",
    "category": "grow",
    "session_id": "test-session"
  }'
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Query Builder Module**: Extract GAQL query building logic
2. **Data Processing Module**: Separate raw data processing
3. **Claude Integration**: Dedicated module for Claude API calls
4. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis caching for expensive MCP queries
5. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for each module
